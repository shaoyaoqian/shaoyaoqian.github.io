- The number of elderly patients with calcific aortic stenosis is projected to more than double by 2050 in both the United States and Europe according to a simulation model in 7 decision analysis studies. The pooled prevalence of all aortic stenosis in the elderly was 12.4%, and the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis was 3.4%.

- In 1000 patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk randomized in the PARTNER 3 trial (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve 3) to either balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement, the primary composite end point (death, stroke, or rehospitalization) rate was signifi- cantly lower in the TAVR versus surgical aortic valve replacement group (8.5% versus 15.1%; absolute difference, −6.6 percentage points for noninferior- ity; HR, 0.54). At 2 years, the primary end point was significantly reduced after TAVR compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (11.5% versus 17.4%; HR, 0.63), although TAVR valve thrombosis at 2 years was increased (2.6%; 13 events) com- pared with surgery (0.7%; 3 events).
- Among 96256 transfemoral TAVR procedures, adjusted 30-day mortality was higher at institu- tions with low procedural volume (3.19%) than at institutions with high procedural volume (2.66%; OR, 1.21).
