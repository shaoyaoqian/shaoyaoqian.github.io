A monolithic projection framework for constrained FSI problems with the immersed boundary method


## 摘要

用浸没边界法求解[[受约束的流固耦合问题(constrained fluid–structure interaction, CFSI)]]的[[统一投影框架|(统一投影框架, monolithic projection framework)]]是针对多结构体、多约束的问题提出的。(只能意译了)由于无滑移边界条件存在，需要在流体和固体的交界处强制施加速度连续条件，浸没边界法是天然满足这个条件的，无需额外考虑。将固体之间、固体内部的动力学性质也纳入浸没边界法的方程组统一考虑，最后通过LU分解高效求解。要看懂这篇文章，最重要的是看懂LU分解是怎么处理的。

## 引言

Last five decades have seen the flourishing of modern numerical methods for complex fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems. To solve a typical FSI problem, one method is responsible for the scheduling and communicating between the fluid and structure solvers, while maintaining the original accuracy and efficiency as far as possible.
Among all such methods, the immersed boundary method (IBM) introduced by Peskin [1] is a commonly used fixed-mesh method for FSI problems with complex boundary shapes. It introduces momentum forcing to conduct the interaction between the fluid and structure through their interface, thus transforming a boundary value problem into a general problem with constraints. By interpolating between the fluid and structure, this method avoids the need to generate body-conforming mesh and design special discretization schemes on it. This feature makes IBM extremely suitable for complex boundary problems [2,3], especially situations involving moving and deforming boundaries. Meanwhile, the natural compatibility with all kinds of background meshes ensures that one can use existing fluid solver or simply Cartesian solver to calculate the flow field, which greatly releases the programming burden. With all these advantages, IBM has been widely used in complex moving boundary FSI problems [4], such as particle-laden flows [5], fluid–flexible structure interactions [6–8], biomimetic and biomedical flows [1,9–14].
Readers can find more detailed demonstration of the IBM in the review articles by Mittal and Iaccarino [3], Huang and Tian [15], and Griffith and Patankar [16].
