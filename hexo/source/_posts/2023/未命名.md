## 摘要
我们提出了一种隐式浸没边界法 for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations capable of handling three-dimensional membrane–fluid flow interactions. The goal of our approach is to 大幅增加时间步长 by using the Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov method (JFNK) to advance the location of the elastic membrane implicitly.
The most attractive feature of this Jacobian-free approach is Newton-like nonlinear convergence 构造和存储真实的Jacobi矩阵. The Generalized Minimal Residual method (GMRES), which is a widely used Krylov-subspace iterative method, is used to update the search direction required for each Newton iteration. Each GMRES iteration only requires the action of the Jacobian in the form of matrix–vector products and therefore avoids the need of forming and storing the Jacobian matrix explicitly. Once the location of the boundary is obtained, the elastic forces acting at the discrete nodes of the membrane are computed using a finite element model. We then use the immersed boundary method to calculate the hydrodynamic effects and fluid–structure interaction effects such as membrane deformation. The present scheme has been validated by several examples including an oscillatory membrane initially placed in a still fluid, capsule membranes in shear flows and large deformation of red blood cells subjected to stretching force.

4.4. 压力驱动流中的血红细胞

Using the shear modulus obtained from the previous example, we perform a simulation of the 压力驱动流 involving 32 red blood cells (RBCs) immersed in the fluid. The purpose of this simulation is to 讨论当前隐式浸没边界方法的性能. Specifically, we compare the CPU time that is required for the present implicit scheme and the second-order Runge–Kutta scheme used in [37] to obtain a solution at a given time. In the simulation, the RBCs are initially placed in a box of size $24\mu m\times48\mu m\times12\mu m$，如图15所示. The computational domain is discretized with 64 ? 128 ? 32 uniform grid. The fluid viscosity and density are the same as those in the previous example.
The pressure drop is maintained at 10 cm of water column. Each red blood cell is discretized with 10,242 nodes and 5120 quadratic triangular elements. We measure the computational times required for each scheme to obtain the solution at t = 0.05 s with the in-plane shear modulus of 10 lN/m. We used Dt ¼ 4:5 ? 10?4for our implicit scheme. We can actually choose larger time step while still maintain the stability, but this choice of Dt is due to the accuracy considerations. The maximum time step that is required for the second-order Runge–Kutta scheme to maintain the stability is Dt ¼ 1:875 ? 10?6. All the simulations are performed on a Dual-core AMD Opteron 2 GHz Processor. The positions of the RBCs at t ¼ 0:05 s are shown in Fig. 15(b), applicable for the two different time schemes. We consider periodic boundary conditions for the cells so that the cells which exit at one end of the channel will enter at the other end. 隐格式耗费22分钟，比显格式快43倍。 在剪切模量较大的情况下，隐格式的优势会更大。

## 5. 结论
Conclusions In this paper, 我们提出了一种隐式浸没边界法 for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations capable of handling 三维流体和薄膜的流固耦合作用。 The present study was undertaken with the objective of eliminating time step restrictions by using the Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov method (JFNK) to advance the location of the elastic membrane implicitly.
We have shown the capability of the present technique by applying it to the viscous flow problems involving elastic membranes with bending stiffness in three-dimensional domains. Numerical simulations have been performed for the 粘性流体中的震荡薄膜 to illustrate that the method can maintain stability under relatively large time steps. Simulations have also been performed to reproduce some results for the 简单剪切流中的膜囊 as a validation test for our method. It is found that our numerical results are in good agreement with those reported in literature. The present method was also used to simulate the 光学镊子直接拉伸人红细胞产生的大变形。 We have compared the in-plane shear modulus of the normal human red blood cell with that determined by experimental measurements. The range of 剪切模量 obtained by the present method compares well to that reported previously in the literature. With the obtained shear modulus, the present implicit method has been used to perform simulations of 压力驱动流中的红细胞 to further demonstrate the 方法的性能。
The present algorithm does not include any preconditioned techniques with the GMRES solver. We expect to improve the time step further without increasing the number of GMRES iterations by applying appropriate preconditioners. This will be the subject of future work. (译者注：适用于JFNK方法的预处理技术很少)
